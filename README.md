# DEC-Code-32-bit-Mini-Project

There has been recent interest on designing double error correction (DEC) codes for 32-bit data words that support fast decoding
as they can be useful to protect memories. To that end, solutions based on orthogonal Latin square codes have been recently presented that achieve
fast decoding but require a large number of parity check bits. In this repository, a DEC code derived from difference set codes is implemented in Verilog.


The following modules were implemented in Verilog, using Xilinx Vivado.
This implementation is based on the following IEEE paper:
"A Double Error Correction Code for 32-Bit Data Words With Efficent Decoding"
